## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I decided to learn more about Linux. Mainly to further my own knowledge for personal endeavors, but also since I will be using Linux to host my CMS servers  
- [LinkedIn Learning - Intro to Linux](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-linux) *56m, watched all*
- [LinkedIn Learning - Learning Linux Command Line](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linux-command-line-14447912/learning-linux-command-line?u=2223545) *3hrs, watched 90%*  
I also decided to look into Docker as a potential way of hosting my websites and also as I was personally interested in knowing more about it  
- [LinkedIn Learning - Learning Docker](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-docker-17236240) *1h 56m, watched half, planning to finish in future*
## Estimated Hours
- LinkedIn Learning - 5 hours
## Content Insights
- The Docker Hub allows you to share and download Docker images easily, which makes sharing your containers with others much more streamlined then having to manually transfer project files to other people
- Linux is a much more modular OS compared to Windows or Mac OS. This is due to the fact that each part of the OS can be swapped out for different community built alternatives as opposed to only being able to use the pre-chosen proprietary versions in Windows and Mac OS   
- There are many different distributions you can choose from that are all different in their own way and are made for different use cases. For example you could use a fully featured, ready to use distro such as Ubuntu, or opt for a bare bones distro like Arch, that is designed for maximum user customization
- Learning the Linux CL allows for powerful interactivity with your system, especially for navigation and modifying files as typing text commands is much quicker then navigating a GUI with a mouse  
- There are way too many commands to remember, but by using specific help commands you quickly figure out how to achieve your goal. Listed below are what I found to be the most useful
	- `man <command>` shows manual for command
	- `tab` for autocomplete, double press for possible autocompletion list
	- `apropos <text>`searches a list of installed programs that can be used as commands and checks their descriptions for text that you provide as an argument
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- I've decided to take more advantage of my access to LinkedIn Learning courses to learn more about topics I'm interested from professionals
- Docker solves the issue of "it works on my machine" by allowing you to run software in containers, then share those containers to other systems for testing via images. This feature can allow for easier testing of your software as opposed to having to build VMs or install all necessary dependencies  on each testing machine
- Learning the Linux CL is an important pre-requisite for jobs such as network or system administration, as you will be commonly using Linux servers without a GUI
- Since being proficient with the CL allows you to use your computer faster than with a GUI, it will also lead to you being able to get work done quicker
