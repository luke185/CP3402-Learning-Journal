## Learning Activities & Resources
I needed to touch up on my Joomla skills for my first assignment  
- [LinkedIn Learning - Joomla 4 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/joomla-4-essential-training) *5h 30m, watched majority*

I also needed to learn how to properly do a stand-up meeting  
- [LinkedIn Learning - Agile at Work](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/agile-at-work-driving-productive-agile-meetings) *Only watched stand up meetings section, 5m*

For the practical I needed to learn about how to create a WordPress child theme  
- [LinkedIn Learning - WordPress Building Child Themes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-child-themes-3) *Watched about half*

I have also been personally learning about different Linux distros, specifically focusing a lot on NixOS. This started out as a personal quest to find what I wanted to use for my primary OS but I soon realized that having knowledge of Nix, as well as other distros, is very important for many jobs. I also decided to learn about Hyprland, a Linux tiling compositor    
- [Official Nix Documentation](https://nix.dev/) *Read through to learn about Nix and how to use NixOS*  
- [NixOS: Everything Everywhere All At Once - No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfKlX3rA6E) *My first introduction to NixOS*  
- [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/) *Documentation for Hyprland*  
- [Vimjoyer YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vimjoyer/videos) *Useful content on NixOS and Hyprland*  
## Estimated Hours
- LinkedIn Learning - 6 hours
- Documentation reading - 1 hour
- YouTube - 1 hour *my total time for watching Linux based information is probably much higher, but I have no idea what the actual number is*
## Content Insights
### Joomla
- WordPress's block editor is a much easier to use than Joomla's editor for making non-code based changes, since it is purely drag and drop system that instantly reflects how your final design will look
- For a Joomla site's links to work properly, you must have each article linked to a menu otherwise you will not have any way to access it on the front-end of the website
### Stand-Up Meetings
- Stand-up meetings should only include 3 basic questions;
	- What did I do since the last meeting?
	- What am I doing next?
	- Are there any roadblocks in my way?
- Teams should manage the meeting themselves to avoid scum master / product owner taking over, as this will break the flow and drag out the meeting 
- Should not take more than 15mins in total
### WordPress Child Themes
- Since child themes inherit form the parent theme, it allows you to change / update the parent theme at will without removing the changes made to the child theme
- 'Working in the browser' is a great way to test new CSS as you can instantly see the changes you have made, instead of having to modify your file, save it, then refresh the page. The browser inspector also shows the classes for an element as well as any parent classes, taking any guess work out of knowing what classes to use in your CSS file
### NixOS / Linux
- NixOS is quite different to other Linux distros, as in instead of installing packages individually and modifying config files separately, everything is all done from one single file. Then from that single file you can re-build the OS, creating a new configuration that you can then instantly swap to, and swap back from to an earlier configuration
- NixOS works similar to something like Docker or Vagrant in the sense that you modify a config file to specify how to build your environment
- Nix can also be used as just the Nix shell environment. It allows you to immediately use any program packed with Nix, without installing it permanently. Nix shell can be used in any Linux distro as well as WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and macOS
- Learning more about Hyprland is in-turn teaching me more about window managers, desktop environments and compositors in general and how different ones can and should be used based on what the system in being used for. For instance, on a home computer you would want a nice looking desktop environment / window manager instead of just having a terminal
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
### Stand-Up Meetings
- Knowing what to do when a stand-up meeting is called will both reduce friction with your team and make you seem like a more reliable team member, as opposed to having to be told what to do and learn on the fly
### WordPress Child Themes / 'Working in the browser'
- Being able to take an existing template and add small modifications saves a lot of time compared to having to make an entirely new template, as well as ensuing that your templates will be automatically updated. Implementing this into a companies workflow would ensure that less dev time is spent on unnecessary tasks 
- Having knowledge of time saving tactics like these could allow me to complete tasks faster and to be able to allocate more time to creating a better version of the product
### NixOS / Nix
- There are a growing number of jobs in the IT industry that either require or prefer knowledge of Nix / NixOS, with other 1000 results on LinkedIn
