## Content Insights
- Using single or double quotes for strings will change the way they are processed. Single quotes will simply return whatever is inside them as a string, whereas double quotes will process the content inside as PHP before outputting them. So if you had a variable you wanted to display inside a string, you would need to use double quotes.
- Unlike HTML and CSS, PHP is processed server side only, meaning that the end user will not see any of the PHP code. The server will process all the PHP, then only send the output to the browser, including any HTML code in the PHP file.
- `include` and `require` act as if you copied all the included code inline where the `include` statement is. This can be very useful for splitting up your PHP code into separate files for readability and to be able to re-use code frequently, such as for a page header / footer.
- HTML can be used in PHP files, but PHP cannot be used in HTML files.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- Searching for 'PHP' on job recruitment websites returns a lot of listings in relation to web developers, showing that it's an important pre-requisite
- PHP is the [most used](https://kinsta.com/php-market-share/) server-side programming language on the web, with 79.8% of websites using it. Most of the popular CMSs including WordPress also run on PHP. This shows that learning PHP is a valuable skill to be able to integrate into many different companies / projects, as chances are they are already using PHP to some degree.
