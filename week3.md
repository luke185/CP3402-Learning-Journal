## Content Insights
### Interview Questions
- Prioritize important questions to ensure you get the most useful information before running out of time
- In both asking and answering questions, try to be more succinct as to not waste time and avoid 'waffling on' 
- After being asked a question remember the answer so if you are asked the same question again you can respond immediately  
### WordPress
- Media libraries allow you to use the same media several times on your website while only having to have one saved copy of it
- Using the built-in editor allows you to customize your website without needing to know any HTML / CSS code
- WordPress blocks allow for a very modular approach to website creation. You can move different parts of your website around, change their size and width and remove them very easily. You can also create re-usable blocks for repeatable parts of your website
### Local Hosting
- Vagrant allows for quick creation / management of new VMs with simple CL prompts, instead of having to manually configure a new VM yourself
- Vagrant plugins such as [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) allow you to instantly create a new VM that is already fully setup for your desired purpose. For example; VVV creates a Linux VM that is partitioned ready for WordPress and also installs WordPress to the partition so it's instantly ready to be used
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
### Interview Questions
- In researching what makes for good interview questions to ask my classmates, it also taught me what kind of questions I should have good responses for when I go for an interview in the future
- Using stories is a good way to show evidence of your experience, as it's something you actually did, not just hypothetical 
- By looking at listings for jobs I may potentially want in the future, I can create a to-do list based on the job requirements. Some requirements may be technical skills, whilst others may be social skills
### WordPress / Local Hosting
- 43% of the web uses WordPress, so it's quite likely I would need to use it in the future, especially if I'm working in web development
- If I was creating my own startup website, or a website for any other personal reason, I could use WordPress from the skills I have learned
