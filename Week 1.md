## Learning Activities & Resources
The first major thing I knew I needed to do was refresh my knowledge on basic html and CSS coding.  
- I decided to utilize the LinkedIn learning resource and watched a few videos from the 'HTML Essential Training' course. From the sections of the course I watched I refreshed by memory on basic HTML and CSS structure and some of the different tags that can be used, it wasn't enough information for me to code a whole website from scratch but it would allow me to read the necessary  code.

Whilst coding my website I realized there were a couple of HTML tags that I had forgot the format for. 
- I used the [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)website and their provided examples to quickly find the answers I was looking for. I decided on using this site as it has reliable information that is straight to the point.

I also looked back on my prac work from CP1406 (Web Design) to refresh my memory on HTML and CSS I had already learned and see examples of code in use. 
## Estimated Hours
I spent around 2 hours doing study and 5 hours on the website
## Content Insights
GitHub Pages is a very easy to use and useful for quickly hosting static webpages. I can see myself using it in the future for testing webpages on other devices or sharing webpages with other people.  
Bootstrap is a great tool for building a great looking website very quickly, however it does require you to read through the code a bit first and learn it to be able to use it effectively and make meaningful changes. 
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I can see how Bootstrap could be used to quickly build out a website for a business saving money and time as opposed to creating a website from scratch. It would benefit me to be more familiar with Bootstrap in case I am in that situation in the future. 
After completing the prac I was reminded that my understanding of HTML and mainly CSS coding is still behind where it should be, for both this subject and working in the industry, so I plan to further my skills over the course of this subject by watching more of the LinkedIn learning courses. My hope is to be able to create a professional looking website from scratch.
